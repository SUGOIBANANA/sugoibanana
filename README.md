## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**SUGOIBANANA/sugoibanana** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ I'm currently working on some cool projects! What projects? Nah, it wouldn't be cool if I told you now.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ''Japython'' or 'She', 'She Plus Plus', 'She's Sharp' and 'She's Sharper'.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with 'Hyper Text always Malfunctions a Lot'!
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about OS (the only one where 'Start' means 'Shutdown')
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: Only if you dare... uhh, the email is below ğŸ‘‡
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: Oniichan~
- âš¡ Fun fact: the Pronouns above was wrong, or were they?
